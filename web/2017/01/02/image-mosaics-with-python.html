                <p>
                    I'm sure you've seen an image mosaic before. Each pixel in
                    the original image has been replaced with an entire image.
                    The tiled, jagged result usually resembles the original
                    image at a distance and, when good component images are
                    chosen, presents the viewer with a very complex image to
                    explore. Let's create some with python.
                </p>

                <h2>The General Idea</h2>

                <p>

                    We start with a reference image: this is the image whose
                    pixels will be replaced with individual tile images. The
                    larger the image, the larger the output. I recommend you
                    start small. Choose a relatively simple image, and scale it
                    downwards. I've found that images in the size range of
                    20-30 pixels tall or wide produce good output.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reference image should also not include transparency.
                    When I was first writing this code, I couldn't figure out
                    why the simple image I was using for a reference image
                    never resulted in output that looked anything other than
                    random. As I dug into the problem, I realized that every
                    single pixel was the same color. But the image still looked
                    like an image because each pixel had varied transparency.
                    You can avoid this problem by ensuring your reference image
                    is not transparent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can find the reference image for this article
                    <a href="/2017/01/02/reference.jpg">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is what it looks scaled up to a visible size:
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/02/reference.jpg" style="width: 80px" />

                <p>
                    Yep. Cross of the Greek flag. I recently took a trip to
                    Greece, and the pictures from the trip will also form our
                    tile sources as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also need a directory of images to use as sources. Each
                    image will be cropped square and scaled down to the tile
                    size as it is loaded. Technically, you can use other aspect
                    ratios for the pixels of your mosaic. But the presented
                    code doesn't allow for that. The images will be cropped
                    square by trimming evenly from each side (i.e. a
                    center-square crop). Other methods certainly exist: see my
                    <a href="https://github.com/f0rk/thumbify">thumbify
                    project</a> for a look at alternative methods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each source image will then have its average color
                    computed. The average color is computed by averaging the
                    red, blue, and green channels individually and then
                    returning that triple as the average color.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can find the source images for this article
                    <a href="/2017/01/02/sources.tar.gz">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The last important idea is tile size. This is how large
                    each component image of the mosaic is. The larger the tile
                    size, the larger and more detailed the output image.
                    However, there is a memory trade-off (in this
                    implementation) with using larger tile sizes. I find a size
                    of 80 works well from a memory and output size standpoint.
                    You can then scale the final image as needed for printing,
                    etc.
                </p>

                <h2>Our choice of libraries</h2>

                <p>
                    Since I know next to nothing about how image processing
                    works in practice and because I'm way too lazy to even
                    explore reinventing this wheel, our image processing will
                    be done by <code>pillow</code> the <code>PIL</code> fork.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's also some light math that I will handle by using
                    <code>numpy</code> (though, we could probably get on
                    without it).
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're using the code from the repo (skip to the end for
                    link), run the setup script. Otherwise just make sure you
                    have these two dependencies installed. They're the only
                    ones.
                </p>

                <h2>Loading our sources</h2>

                <p>
                    As mentioned above, we load all of our source images up
                    front and perform some preprocessing on them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, we crop the image:
                </p>

<pre>def crop_image(img):

    if img.width > img.height:
        new_width = img.height
        new_height = img.height

        start_x = (img.width - img.height) / 2
        start_y = 0

        img = img.crop((
            start_x,
            start_y,
            start_x + new_width,
            start_y + new_height,
        ))
    elif img.height > img.width:
        new_width = img.width
        new_height = img.width

        start_x = 0
        start_y = (img.height - img.width) / 2

        img = img.crop((
            start_x,
            start_y,
            start_x + new_width,
            start_y + new_height,
        ))

    return img

source_image = crop_image(source_image)</pre>

                <p>
                    Then we thumbnail the image to the appropriate tile size,
                    to save on memory:
                </p>

<pre>source_image.thumbnail((tile_size, tile_size))</pre>

                <p>
                    Next, we'll convert the image to black and white (if
                    necessary) and force it to RGB. This step is necessary to
                    get <code>r, g, b</code> triples for calculating the
                    average color:
                </p>

<pre>if not is_color:
    source_image = source_image.convert("L")

# always need to force into RGB only
source_image = source_image.convert("RGB")</pre>

                <p>
                    And here we calculate the average color:
                </p>

<pre>def average_color(img):
    """Return the average color of the given image.

    :param img: An image object.
    :returns: A three-tuple representing the average color.

    """

    h = img.histogram()

    # split into red, green, blue
    r = h[0:256]
    g = h[256:512]
    b = h[512:768]

    def wavg(s):
        """Find the weighted average of the sequence, which is a color channel.

        :param s: A color channel sequence.
        :returns: The weighted average.

        """

        # i is the index which is the channel value. w is the weight which is
        # the frequency of occurence.
        weighted = sum(i*w for i, w in enumerate(s))

        # sum of all values, which is how many times they occur
        total = sum(s)

        return int(weighted / float(total))

    return (wavg(r), wavg(g), wavg(b))

average_r, average_g, average_b = average_color(source_image)</pre>

                <p>
                    You'll note that we're using the image's histogram to do
                    this. You could also iterate of the image's pixels and
                    compute the average that way, but the histogram method is
                    faster. I had originally iterated over pixels, but the
                    implementation was really too slow to be usable when the
                    number of source images was large.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here are some of our sample tile images converted to their
                    average color:
                </p>

                    Varying shades of tinted gray. Alternatively, we could
                    attempt to choose the most dominant color from the image.
                    For images with a limited set of colors, this might be a
                    better approximation of what the eye is seeing. Here are
                    some examples of that:

                    Now that our source images are loaded, we need to replace
                    our pixels with images. Good mosaics limit repetition of
                    images to the minimum amount possible. We'd like to mimic
                    this, so we'll select from our pool of source images
                    without replacement, until the pool is empty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And yet, if we simply iterate over the pixels from left to
                    right (or whatever simple pattern) as if we were reading
                    the image left-to-right, the results will be less than
                    optimal. All of the best matching images will cluster on
                    the left, and the image will start to degrade in quality as
                    we work our way across. Here's an example of what that
                    looks like:
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/02/ordered-mosaic.jpg" />

                <p>
                    If we had a lot more source images, the problem wouldn't be
                    as pronounced. Even with thousands of images, though, you
                    can still run into this issue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And the code:
                </p>

<pre>def ordered_pixels(reference_image):

    pixels = []
    for x in range(reference_image.width):
        for y in range(reference_image.height):
            pixels.append((x, y))

    return pixels</pre>

                <p>
                    The left-to-right pattern is a result of us iterating over
                    columns, rather than rows. The pattern would just go top to
                    bottom if we iterated y before x, though.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moving on, we could attempt to improve on this by saying
                    that midtones are the most important pixels and therefor
                    should be filled first. Which is an improvement for our
                    reference image:
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/02/midtone-mosaic.jpg" />

                <p>
                    Related code:
                </p>

<pre>def midtone_pixels(reference_image):

    with_brightness = _pixels_with_brightness(reference_image)

    total_brightness = sum([b for b, _ in with_brightness])
    average_brightness = total_brightness / len(with_brightness)

    def midtone_sort(v):
        b, _ = v
        return abs(average_brightness - b)

    with_brightness.sort(key=midtone_sort)

    return [(x, y) for _, (x, y) in with_brightness]</pre>

                <p>
                    Darkest is an improvement, too:
                </p>


                <img src="/2017/01/02/darkest-mosaic.jpg" />

                <p>
                    Code for darkest:
                </p>

<pre>def darkest_pixels(reference_image):

    with_brightness = _pixels_with_brightness(reference_image)

    with_brightness.sort()

    return [(x, y) for _, (x, y) in with_brightness]</pre>

                <p>
                    However, it seems brightest produces a good-er image for us:
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/02/brightest-mosaic.jpg" />

                <p>
                    And code for brightest:
                </p>

<pre>def brightest_pixels(reference_image):

    pixels = darkest_pixels(reference_image)
    pixels.reverse()

    return pixels</pre>

                <p>
                    I would say the output using darkest is probably slightly
                    more defined, but the lightest is more true to the color of
                    the original image.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also note that if we had a different, more nuanced reference
                    image and possibly a different set of source images, the
                    outcome could be different. You may want to play around
                    with these different methods to see if they offer an
                    improvement for your purposes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The default implementation is to choose pixels at random
                    and try to fill them. You may not always get a great image
                    on the first try, but run it a few times to generate a
                    dozen or so candidates. You can then select the one that
                    you think looks best. Which is, after all, important.
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/02/random-mosaic.jpg" />

                <p>
                    And the unintersting random code:
                </p>

<pre>def random_pixels(reference_image):

    pixels = ordered_pixels(reference_image)

    random.shuffle(pixels)

    return pixels</pre>

                <p>
                    Not an improvement over darkest. We'll choose darkest for
                    our "final" image. Play around with the various options to
                    see which produces a good output for you.
                </p>

                <h2>Finding matches</h2>

                <p>
                    Once we've selected our pixels, we need to find a matching
                    image. We do this by comparing the "distance" between the
                    average color of the source images and the color of the
                    given pixel. We use the <code>norm</code> function from
                    <code>numpy</code>'s linear algebra library to achieve
                    this. <code>norm</code> gives the length of a vector,
                    which we will use to determine how close each pixel and the
                    average color of each source image are:
                </p>

<pre>pixel = reference_image.getpixel((x, y))
r = pixel[0]
g = pixel[1]
b = pixel[2]
reference_vec = numpy.array([[r, g, b]])

normed_images = []
for image, avg_color in pool:
    source_vec = numpy.array([avg_color])

    norm = numpy.linalg.norm(reference_vec - source_vec)
    normed_images.append((norm, image, avg_color))

normed_images.sort()</pre>

                <p>
                    But we also don't want to be too greedy. If we always take
                    the closest matching pixel, we tend to end up with similar
                    images clustered in similar looking pixel locations. This
                    isn't a very good look for the output.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Instead, we choose randomly among the closest 20:
                </p>

<pre>top20 = normed_images[:20]
random.shuffle(top20)

_, selected_image, avg_color = top20[0]

pool.remove((selected_image, avg_color))</pre>

                <h2>Other approaches</h2>

                <p>
                    In researching this post, I came across a really cool
                    article on the Wolfram blog about
                    <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2008/05/02/making-photo-mosaics/">using Mathematica to create image mosaics</a>.
                    It goes through a bunch of other interesting approaches.
                    I may cover the implementation of them in python in a
                    future post.

                <h2>Generating the ouptut</h2>

                <p>
                    While we were selecting images for each pixel, we were
                    placing the source image of choice into an N x M matrix,
                    initially populated with <code>Node</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After we've populated the matrix, we can simply walk over
                    the rows and columns and paste each tile into the output
                    image:
                </p>

<pre>y_offset = 0
for row in output_matrix:

    x_offset = 0

    for image in row:

        paste_box = (
            x_offset,
            y_offset,
            x_offset + tile_size,
            y_offset + tile_size,
        )

        output_image.paste(image, paste_box)

        x_offset += tile_size

    y_offset += tile_size

return output_image</pre>

                <p>
                    And that's it!
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/02/final-mosaic.jpg" />

                <p>
                    We also explored using the most common color above. Without
                    revisiting every moscaic, let's see what a final ouptut
                    using the most common color looks like:
                </p>
