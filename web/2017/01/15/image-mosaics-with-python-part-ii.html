                <p>
                    In the second part of the series on image mosaics, we
                    explore creating mosaics with a stochastic method.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="/2017/01/02/image-mosaics-with-python.html">
                        (In the first part, we explored other methods. There's
                        also good background on the terms used in this
                        article.)
                    </a>
                </p>

                <h2>What do you mean by stochastic?</h2>

                <p>
                    By stochastic, I mean that the output image is constructed
                    by a series of random actions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first of these is selecting a set of tile images. We
                    choose an image from our pool of source images to represent
                    each pixel in the reference images. At this point, the
                    image is completely random.
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/15/random.jpg" />

                <p>

                    We then select pairs of pixels in the reference image at
                    random. Examining the current source images assigned to
                    each of these reference pixels, we see if the output image
                    would be improved by swapping them. If so, we swap the
                    images.
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/15/swap-before.jpg" />
                <img src="/2017/01/15/swap-after.jpg" />

                <p>
                    We then perform this operation thousands of times. At the
                    end we (hopefully) have an mosaic image that looks like the
                    reference image.
                </p>

                <img src="/2017/01/15/final-mosaic.jpg" />

                <h2>When do we swap?</h2>

                <p>
                    In the first installment of this series, we defined how
                    well a pixel in the reference image was represented by a
                    source image by calculating a representative color from the
                    source image and comparing it to the reference pixel's
                    color. This comparison was performed using the norm
                    function, which, essentially, calculates the distances
                    between the two colors by treating the RGB values as XYZ
                    coordinates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using this same distance logic, we decide to swap whenever
                    the distance represented by the swap is less than the
                    distance represented by the current arrangement:
                </p>

<pre># swapping is an improvement, perform the swap
if swapped_norm_1 + swapped_norm_2 &lt; current_norm_1 + current_norm_2:

    output_matrix[loc_1[1]][loc_1[0]] = source_2
    output_matrix[loc_2[1]][loc_2[0]] = source_1</pre>

				<p>
                    By performing this operation thousands of times, we expect
                    to reduce the overall "distance" between the reference
                    image and output mosaic.
                </p>

                <h2>Initial population influence</h2>

                <p>
                    In generating a mosaic in this way, the initial population
                    of images has more influence on the output image than in
                    the methods mentioned in the first part. This is because if
                    the pool of available images is larger than the number
                    needed to generate the output mosaic we potentially don't
                    have access to better matches if we start by selecting a
                    random subset of the pool.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course, if the output mosaic is larger than the pool,
                    there is still some impact. This is because images will be
                    repeated, but the repeated images may not be the "best"
                    ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are some solutions to this problem. One possible
                    approach is randomly choose an image from the pool to swap
                    with an image currently selected to generate the output
                    mosaic. We could set a threshold of, say, 0.1, and write
                    the appropriate code to say "if <code>random.random() &lt; 0.1</code>
                    swap from the pool". This approach is not
                    implemented, but should be straightforward.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As always, there is value in running the algorithm multiple
                    times and attempting to select an output that looks good
                    visually.
                </p>

                <h2>Talking 'bout my generation(s)</h2>

                <p>
                    The default number of generations is 1,000,000. This is
                    overkill for smaller images, but works better for larger
                    ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can actually watch the image converge by generating an
                    output image for each generation and then stitching them
                    into an animation (first 10,000 generations):
                </p>
