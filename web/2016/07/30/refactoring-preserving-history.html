                <p>
                    At work and in many open source projects there is a common
                    pattern of how to manage your code: everything in separate
                    projects. While this keeps everything separate it does
                    introduce some other challenges:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Branches or tags (depending on your workflow) must be
                        created in every repository for every release if you
                        are using versioned releases.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Certain code elements may be repeated in each repo (for
                        example, <code>setup.py</code> or the repository's
                        <code>__init__.py</code> file).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Certain configuration files may need to be repeated
                        (for example, <code>.coveragerc</code>).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Organization patterns for files and naming conventions
                        may begin to vary between repos.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Moving code between repos or out of a repo destroys the
                        history of the moved files.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We'll be touching on this last item.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A colleague asked me the other day how to preserve the
                    history of some files as they were migrated into another
                    repo. This is something we've done many times. Code
                    accumulates in one repo that's sort of related (or in the
                    "core" repository, an antipattern) and then later needs to
                    be shared with another project. A new project is then
                    created and the files are copied into it. Unfortunately,
                    the history does not travel with them. At the time the
                    question was posed to me, I did not have a good answer.
                    Later that night as I showered, however, I came up with a
                    halfway solution that at least allows history to be
                    preserved when moving code into a brand new repo:
                </p>

<pre>cp -ipr oldrepo newrepo
cd newrepo
delete-the-unwanted-files</pre>

                <p>
                    Simply copy the old repo to a new repo and delete the
                    unwanted files. Using mercurial, you would issue:
                </p>

<pre>hg mv oldrepo newrepo
hg rm -f newrepo/herp.py</pre>

                <p>

                    Along with some additional moving and renaming (and
                    probably the use of <code>sed</code> or
                    <code>perl -p -i -e</code>) you will have the entire
                    history of the remaining files.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course, you also end up with the history of all the
                    other files that were in the repo as well. For larger,
                    older repos and those with large files, this may represent
                    an undesirable overhead. It's not perfect for all
                    situations but can be useful in a pinch.
                </p>
