                <h1>Jimmy</h1>
                <h3>11 July 2016</h3>

                <p>
                    Jimmy is a chatoic chatbot that is part of the cultural
                    genome of Truveris. The name and concept was originally
                    sourced from a stackoverflow question which was then
                    deleted (but is <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/">now preserved on the Coding Horror blog</a>).
                    Since then, Jimmy-proofing has become a way of thinking and
                    a kind of mantra.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also did what any reasonable software team would do:
                    bring Jimmy to life. And thus, Jimmy the clueless markov
                    chain bot was born.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And he's got a face, of course:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <img title="jimmy, shamelessly stolen from the link above" src="jimmy.png" />
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the prototypical clueless developer, Jimmy has just
                    graduated from college and is ready to refactor your
                    systems ever so carefully. The havoc that Jimmy can wreak
                    is not to be understated. Awful code is a technical debt
                    that will have to be paid down with a rewrite. Jimmy is
                    inventing new abstractions (think Jackson Pollock style),
                    writing code using only side effects, and passing new and
                    exotic arguments to functions. Jimmy-proofing your system
                    is an attempt to prevent all of these from happening.
                </p>

                <h3>You Are Jimmy</h3>

                <p>
                    "I am become Jimmy, the destroyer of codes" as it was
                    written in the Baghavad Gita. In some ways and at some
                    times, we were, are, and will be Jimmy. Jimmy exists to
                    remind us of the consequences of our well intended but
                    possibly ill informed programming decisions. Jimmy is the
                    chaos monkey of your codebase. The code I wrote many years
                    ago had many problems. It always does. And years from now,
                    you will be trying to modify that code. Or repurpose it
                    slightly. And if you Jimmy-proofed your code, you will be
                    grateful.
                </p>

                <h3>What is Jimmy-proofing?</h3>

                <p>
                    The most important aspects of Jimmy-proofing are failing
                    fast, being explicit, and testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I often see statements of the form:
                </p>

<pre>message = None
if state == constants.STATUS_PENDING:
    message = "PENNED IN"
elif state == constants.STATUS_RUNNING:
    message = "RUN IN WITH THE LAW"

return message</pre>

                <p>
                    That missing else drives me nuts. And it points at two
                    things: failing fast and being explicit. What if this
                    function isn't supposed to handle any other states and is
                    simply relying on the caller to verify it is doing the
                    right thing? What if it is supposed to (possibly even
                    documented that way) but doesn't? What if it's just a
                    thinko? All of these questions can addressed with some good
                    ol' fashioned explicit failure (or maybe not failure). If
                    that if block had ended:
                </p>

<pre>else:
    raise Exception("Unhandled state {}".format(repr(state)))</pre>

                <p>
                    You would know that only those two states are allowed.
                    Maybe Jimmy just passed the wrong value. Maybe he added a
                    new state and forgot to address this location. But now we
                    have Jimmy-proofed this function because (hopefully) it
                    will fail in development or testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, maybe this function can be called safely
                    without needing to be one of those two states. You should
                    write:
                </p>

<pre>else:
    pass</pre>

                <p>
                    This will explicitly state that you know this block can
                    handle arbitrary values. It will upset your coverage
                    checker, but add the appropriate pragma and you'll live.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What about testing you ask? Testing is essential for two
                    reasons. The first is that the above example fails during
                    testing instead of during a live news demo of your
                    application. The other is that testing encourages the
                    construction of testable abstractions. Testable
                    abstractions tend to be distinct, modular blocks of code.
                    Just what we're looking for and just what we're trying to
                    prevent jimmy from not creating. You should have reasonably
                    good test coverage and run your tears frequently and as a
                    part of your build process. This keeps Jimmy (remember, you
                    are Jimmy. I am Jimmy. We are all Jimmy) out of production
                    and behind our desks.
                </p>

                <h3>So tell me about the bot</h3>

                <p>
                    The part you've been dying to hear and I've been living to
                    write. Jimmy was a markov chain bot based on Hailo that was
                    trained on our chat server logs. He had a life of his own.
                    A personality. A guru. A sage. A master of wise sayings.
                    Sometimes spewing gibberish. Jimmy would frequently offer
                    advice, troll other bots, learn foul language, and insult
                    his creator. He was also an important outlet. When someone
                    wanted to say something funny, or sarcastic, or air a
                    complaint, they would say it to Jimmy. Jimmy was a kind of
                    collective catharsis and a safe outlet. Because emotion in
                    written speech is often hard to detect, Jimmy served as a
                    proxy &lt;sarcasm&gt; tag. This allowed frustrations to be vented
                    without actually calling out anyone directly and allowing
                    the problem to be made open.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jimmy was decommissioned when we moved to mattermost for a
                    few reasons. But his spirit still lives on. He is still
                    addressed directly and most people still understand what
                    that means.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I said earlier that we are all Jimmy. In the programmer
                    sense, we have all written shitty code. In the bot sense,
                    all of our chatter contributed to his personality. We are
                    all Jimmy. Let that keep us humble.
                </p>

                <p class="small">
                    P.S. Jimmy is coming back! The details of that, however,
                    will be the subject of another blog post.
