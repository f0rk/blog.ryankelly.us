                <p>
                    AWS makes it easy to throw up a quick API. But how do you
                    prevent abuse? You are, after all, paying for the resources
                    that others are using. One way is with API keys and usage
                    plans.
                </p>

                <h2>What are API keys?</h2>

                <p>
                    In the general sense, API keys are a token that authorizes
                    you to access a resource. API keys are <strong>not</strong>
                    a form of authentication, as API keys are not generally
                    considered secrets nor are they necessarily protected as
                    such.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On AWS, API Keys are a component of the API Gateway product
                    offering. They are a system that allows for the creation
                    and management of API keys as associated with API Gateway
                    specific concepts, such as deployments or Usage Plans, or
                    AWS specific concepts, such as the SaaS Marketplace.
                </p>

                <h2>What are Usage Plans?</h2>

                <p>
                    Usage Plans are an API Gateway component that allows you to
                    assign specific API keys to your API consumers and control
                    the rate and quantity of requests that they make.
                    Additionally, you can also query how many requests were
                    made to your API by each Usage Plan. If you bill
                    per-request for your API, this feature allows you to easily
                    track how many requests were made, report on it, and
                    through integration with other Amazon services, easily bill
                    for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Usage plans aren't strictly necessary for you to use API
                    keys. However, I would recommend that if you are exposing
                    APIs to clients, setting up rate limiting and request
                    limits as well as tracking these metrics are necessary to
                    ensure your services are not abused. Sometimes, bugs in the
                    software of clients can lead to runaway request conditions.
                    Neither you (since your API is limited by AWS) nor your
                    client (since they are being billed by request or would
                    like to at least access your service) would like situations
                    like this. Limit your APIs.
                </p>

                <h2>Why use API Keys?</h2>

                <p>
                    The primary strength of the API key approach is simplicity.
                    The value is passed as part of the <code>x-api-key</code>
                    header. There is no tricky crypto or request/response
                    challenge sequence to contend with. Consumers of your API
                    will be able to quickly and easily integrate with you. In a
                    situation where you bill for usage, this can help with
                    onboard and reduce time to revenue generation.
                </p>

                <h2>What about arguments against?</h2>

                <p>
                    API keys doesn't integrate with Amazon's IAM offering. This
                    can introduce challenges when using API Gateway to manage
                    solely internal services when you want to central manage
                    all access with IAM. You can still manage access with IAM,
                    just not with API keys. For that, you will need to use a
                    custom authorizer (a perfectly fine, albeit more involved,
                    solution).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Too, API keys don't support HMAC signatures or other crypto
                    goodies. The key is a string. Having the string gives you
                    access. Depending on your use case, you may want to opt for
                    a more secure approach.
                </p>

                <h2>Alright, alright. Show me the code.</h2>

                <p>
                    First, we need to create an API Key:
                </p>

<pre>meditations_api_key = apigateway_client.create_api_key(
    name="meditations",
    description="ohm",
    enabled=True,
    generateDistinctId=True,
)</pre>

                <p>
                    Here, we create a named key that is enabled and we let API
                    Gateway generate the key value for us. We could pass our
                    own value as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, we'll create a Usage Plan:
                </p>

<pre>meditations_usage_plan = apigateway_client.create_usage_plan(
    name="meditations",
    description="ohm",
    apiStages=[
        {
            "apiId": api["id"],
            "stage": "prod",
        },
    ],
    throttle={
        "burstLimit": 250,
        "rateLimit": 100,
    },
    quota={
        "limit": 10000,
        "period": "DAY",
    }
)</pre>

                <p>
                    We've created a usage plan for our meditations API for our
                    and prod stage. We've set the per-second request limit to
                    100 (<code>rateLimit</code>) and given some padding to 250
                    for bursting (<code>burstLimit</code>).  The way these work
                    are documented by AWS', but I didn't have a clear sense of
                    over what time period the burst limit applied. We limit the
                    users of our usage plan to 10,000 requests per day. You can
                    also specify by week and month.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that usage is by plan, not by key. You can have many
                    keys associated with a usage plan. Speaking of which:
                </p>

<pre>meditations_usage_plan_key = apigateway_client.create_usage_plan_key(
    usagePlanId=meditations_usage_plan["id"],
    keyId=meditations_api_key["id"],
    keyType="API_KEY",
)</pre>

                <p>
                    We need to associate our key with our usage plan.
                    <code>keyType</code> is required but only assumes the value
                    <code>API_KEY</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're now very close to getting API keys up running. The
                    last step is to require the endpoint to use an API key.
                    Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to get this done with
                    swagger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, we'll brute force it with boto:
                </p>

<pre>meditations_resources = apigateway_client.get_resources(restApiId=api["id"])

main_resource = [res for res in meditations_resources["items"] if res["path"] == "/"][0]

apigateway_client.update_method(
    restApiId=api["id"],
    resourceId=main_resource["id"],
    httpMethod="POST",
    patchOperations=[
        {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/apiKeyRequired",
            "value": "true",
        }
    ]
)</pre>

                <p>
                    A hack, for sure. But better than nothing. Or the
                    console...
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alternatively, go the console, API Gateway &gt; APIs &gt;
                    Meditations &gt; / &gt; POST &gt; Method Request &gt; API
                    Key Required. Flip that to true and save.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If anyone knows how to do this via swagger, drop me a line.
                </p>

                <h2>BEHOLD!</h2>

<pre>$ curl -X POST https://a1b2c3d4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
{"message": "Forbidden"}
$ curl -X POST -H "x-api-key: zM9Z0CNeM25UeMprorUJC8JTo2ypYj1Z2yR2Jwi7" https://a1b2c3d4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
{"status": "success", "meditation": "testing is broken because I'm lazy"}</pre>

                <p>
                    And that's all there is to it.
