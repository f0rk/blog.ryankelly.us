                <p>
                    Lately, there's been a lot of buzz in the computing world
                    about "serverless". Serverless is a concept wherein you
                    don't manage any servers yourself but instead provide your
                    code or executables to a service that executes them for
                    you. This is execution-as-a-service. It introduces many
                    opportunities and also presents its own unique set of
                    challenges.
                </p>

                <h2>A brief digression on computing</h2>

                <p>
                    In the beginning, there was... well. It's a little
                    complicated. At the very beginning, we had mechanical
                    computers. Then along came ENIAC. Things really don't start
                    to get "mass production", however, until the advent of
                    mainframes.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1950s - Mainframes</li>
                    <li>1960s - Minicomputers</li>
                    <li>1994 - Rack servers</li>
                    <li>2001 - Blade servers</li>
                    <li>2000s - Virtual servers</li>
                    <li>2006 - Cloud servers</li>
                    <li>2013 - Containers</li>
                    <li>2014 - Serverless</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="small">
                    These are rough release/popularity dates. Argue amongst
                    yourselves about the timeline.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The progression here seems to be a trend toward executing
                    smaller and smaller units of functionality. Each step down
                    generally represents a decrease in the operational overhead
                    and an increase in the operational flexibility.
                </p>

                <h2>The possibilities</h2>

                <p>
                    Yay! Serverless! But. What advantages do we gain by going
                    serverless? And what challenges do we face?
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>No billing when there is no execution.</b> In my mind,
                    this is a huge selling point. When no one is using your
                    site or your API, you aren't paying for. No ongoing
                    infrastructure costs.  Pay only for what you need. In some
                    ways, this is the fulfillment of the cloud computing
                    promise "pay only for what you use".
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>No servers to maintain or secure.</b> Server maintenance
                    and security is handled by your vendor (you could, of
                    course, host serverless yourself, but in some ways this
                    seems like a step in the wrong direction). Since your
                    execution times are also limited, the patching of security
                    issues is also simplified since there is nothing to
                    restart. This should all be handled seamlessly by your
                    vendor.
                <p>

                <p>
                    <b>Unlimited scalability.</b> This is another big one.
                    Let's say you write the next Pok√©mon Go. Instead of your
                    site being down every couple of days, serverless lets you
                    just keep growing and growing. A double-edged sword, for
                    sure (with great scalability comes great... bills), but if
                    your service's profitability depends on being up, then
                    serverless can help enable that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Forced microservices architecture.</b> This one really
                    goes both ways. Microservices seem to be a good way to
                    build flexible, scalable, and fault-tolerant architectures.
                    On the other hand, if your business' services aren't
                    designed this way, you're going to have difficulty adding
                    serverless into your existing architecture.
                </p>

                <h2>But now your stuck on <i>their</i> platform</h2>

                <p>
                    <b>Limited range of environments.</b> You get what the
                    vendor gives. You want to go serverless in Rust? You're
                    probably out of luck.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Limited preinstalled packages.</b> You get what the
                    vendor pre-installs. But you may be able to supply your
                    own.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Limited execution time.</b> Your function can only run
                    for so long. If you have to process a 1TB file you will
                    likely need to 1) use a work around or 2) use something
                    else.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Forced microservices architecture.</b> See above.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Limited insight and ability to instrument.</b> Just what
                    <b>is</b> your code doing? With serverless, it is basically
                    impossible to drop in a debugger and ride along. You still
                    have the ability to log and emit metrics the usual way but
                    these generally can only take you so far. Some of the most
                    difficult problems may be out of reach when the occur in a
                    serverless environment.
                </p>

                <h2>The playing field</h2>

                <p>
                    Since the introduction of AWS Lambda in 2014, the number of
                    offerings has expanded quite a bit. Here are a few popular
                    ones:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>AWS Lambda - The Original</li>
                    <li>OpenWhisk - Available on IBM's Bluemix cloud</li>
                    <li>Google Cloud Functions</li>
                    <li>Azure Functions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    While all of these have their relative strengths and
                    weaknesses (like, C# support on Azure or tight integration
                    on any vendor's platform) the biggest player here is AWS.

                        <b>Execution Role.</b> Every function executes as a

                        <b>Role Policy.</b> Every function executes as a role,
                        and every role needs permission to do things. Our
                        lambda function doesn't do much, so we'll just add some
                        logging permissions.

                        of these for our API here (i.e., everything is
                        production, yolo, etc.), but know that they exist and
                        for a real production-ready service you will probably
                        want to use development and staging environments.

                        want to add some monitoring in the form of cloudwatch
                        alarms for errors and billing. Note that you should

                <h2>The <code>deploy.py</code> script</h2>

                <p>
                    This one is rather long (sadly) and I won't be including it
                    here. It basically goes through each of the items under
                    "Things in AWS" and ensures each item exists.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a caveat here: If you have just created your AWS
                    account, sending email with SES (Simple Email Service) will
                    not yet be available. Presumably, this is to limit the use
                    of SES as a platform for spammers. As a result, the
                    monitoring portions of the deploy script will fail with an
                    error like "An error occurred (OptInRequired) when calling
                    the PutMetricAlarm operation: The AWS Access Key Id needs a
                    subscription for the service". This will work itself out if
                    you wait for a day or so. For the time being, you can
                    comment out the related code in
                    <code>tools/deploy.py</code> (around lines 211-273).
                </p>

                <h2>Let's deploy this shit</h2>

                <p>
                    Just run <code>./tools/deploy.py</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Well. Almost. There seems to be some issue applying
                    privileges that I can't seem to figure out. Your lambda
                    function will fail to execute because API Gateway does not
                    have permissions to execute your function. The specific
                    error should be "Execution failed due to configuration
                    error: Invalid permissions on Lambda function". I am not
                    sure how to add these using botocore. You can work around
                    this issue by going to the AWS console (sadness), locating
                    your API, going to the <code>/ POST</code> endpoint, going
                    to integration request, clicking the pencil icon next to
                    "Lambda Function" to edit it, and then saving it. You'll
                    get a popup stating "You are about to give API Gateway
                    permission to invoke your Lambda function". Click "OK".
                </p>

                    When you're finished with that, take the URL that
                    <code>./tools/deploy.py</code> printed and call it like so
                    to see your new API in action:
                </p>

<pre>$ curl -X POST https://a1b2c3d4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
{"status": "success", "meditation": "the count of machines abides"}</pre>

                <h2>Running Locally</h2>

                <p>
                    One unfortunate thing about AWS Lambda is that there isn't
                    really a good way to run your code locally. In our case, we
                    will use a simple flask server to host the appropriate
                    endpoint locally and handle calling our handler function:
                </p>

<pre>from __future__ import absolute_import

from flask import Flask, jsonify

from server.meditate import handler


app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["POST"])
def index():

    class FakeContext(object):
        aws_request_id = "XXX"

    return jsonify(**handler(None, FakeContext()))

app.run(host="0.0.0.0")</pre>

                <p>
                    You can run this in the repo with
                    <code>./tools/serve.sh</code>. Invoke like:
                </p>

<pre>$ curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/
{
    "meditation": "your solution requires a blood eagle",
    "status": "success"
}</pre>

                <h2>Testing</h2>

                <p>
                    You should always test your code. The way we'll be doing
                    this is importing and running our handler function. This is
                    really just plain vanilla python testing:
                </p>

<pre>from __future__ import absolute_import

import unittest

from server.meditate import handler


class SubmitTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_submit(self):

        class FakeContext(object):

            aws_request_id = "XXX"

        response = handler(None, FakeContext())

        self.assertEquals(response["status"], "success")
        self.assertTrue("meditation" in response)</pre>

                <p>
                    You can run the tests in the repo with <code>nose2</code>.
                </p>

                <h2>Other possibilities</h2>

                <p>
                    <b>Seamless integration with AWS services.</b> Using boto,
                    you can pretty simply connect to any of AWS other services.
                    You simply allow your execution role access to these
                    services using IAM and you're on your way. You can get/put
                    files from S3, connect to Dynamo DB, invoke other lambda
                    functions, etc. etc. The list goes on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Accessing a database.</b> You can easily access remote
                    databases as well. Connect to the database at the top of
                    your lambda handler's module. Execute queries on the
                    connection from within the handler function itself. You
                    will (very likely) have to upload the associated package
                    contents from where it is installed locally for this to
                    work. You may also need to statically compile certain
                    libraries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Calling other webservices.</b> API Gateway is also a way
                    to translate the output from one web service into a
                    different form. You can take advantage of this to proxy
                    calls through to a different webservice or provide
                    backwards compatibility when a service changes.
