                    PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is
                    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">"the world's most advanced open source database"</a>.
                    But what makes it so advanced? In this post, we'll be
                    covering what may be my favorite feature: arrays.
                </p>

                <h3>The Basics</h3>

                <p>
                    Arrays allow you store lists of values in a single column.
                    SQL, being strongly typed, allows for only heterogeneous
                    arrays. Any non-array concrete type can be used as the type
                    of an array. Arrays of <code>text</code>? Of course.
                    <code>integer</code>? Yup. <code>xml</code>? Uhh... if
                    you're that crazy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's how you create a table with an array column in
                    postgres:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 13:55:54) [test]&gt; create table array_test (id serial primary key, vals text[]);
CREATE TABLE
Time: 42.664 ms
</pre>

                <small>
                    we don't need a primary key, but it will help with the
                    examples.
                </small>

                <p>
                    Inserting array values:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 13:57:05) [test]&gt; insert into array_test (vals) values ('{foo, bar, "lol wut"}');
INSERT 0 1
Time: 3.938 ms
</pre>

                <p>
                    This is the quoted string format. You can also use the
                    <code>array</code> format:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 13:58:35) [test]&gt; insert into array_test (vals) values (array['que', 'hrm', 'with spaces']);
INSERT 0 1
Time: 2.029 ms</pre>

                <p>
                    And this is what they look like:
                </p>

<pre> id |          vals
----+-------------------------
  1 | {foo,bar,"lol wut"}
  2 | {que,hrm,"with spaces"}</pre>

                <p>
                    Updates can set the entire column value using the formats
                    above. You can also set individual values:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 14:03:47) [test]&gt; begin; update array_test set vals[1] = 'fail' where id = 2;
BEGIN
Time: 0.199 ms
UPDATE 1
Time: 3.332 ms
(postgres@[local]:5432 14:04:09) [test]&gt; commit;
COMMIT
Time: 3.733 ms
(postgres@[local]:5432 14:04:38) [test]&gt; select * from array_test where id = 2;
 id |           vals
----+--------------------------
  2 | {fail,hrm,"with spaces"}</pre>

				<p>
                    Note that arrays in postgres (and SQL) begin with index 1,
                    not index 0.
                </p>

				<h3>Uninteresting so far</h3>

				<p>
                    I agree. But let's play with some of the array functions
                    that postgres provides.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the most useful is <code>unnest</code>:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 14:04:46) [test]&gt; select unnest(vals) from array_test;
   unnest
-------------
 foo
 bar
 lol wut
 fail
 hrm
 with spaces</pre>

                <p>
                    With <code>unnest</code>, you can take array values and
                    make them queryable. You can then perform other operations,
                    such as <code>group by</code> to get, for instance, counts
                    of individual items:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 14:16:43) [test]&gt; select val, count(*) from (select unnest(vals) val from array_test) as s group by 1;
     val     | count
-------------+-------
 foo         |     1
 fail        |     1
 hrm         |     1
 with spaces |     1
 bar         |     1
 lol wut     |     1</pre>

				<p>
                    <code>unnest</code> is probably the single most useful
                    function. The function <code>cardinality</code> is next and
                    returns the number of elements in the array:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 14:24:55) [test]&gt; select *, cardinality(vals) from array_test;
 id |           vals           | cardinality
----+--------------------------+-------------
  1 | {foo,bar,"lol wut"}      |           3
  2 | {fail,hrm,"with spaces"} |           3</pre>

				<h3>
					Operators add some more flavor
				</h3>

				<p>
                    Operators can be used for logical tests or array
                    modifications. For most of my uses of arrays, operators
                    dominate in their manipulation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>@&gt;</code>, and
                    <code>&lt;@</code> operators are commonly used logical
                    operators. These allow you to test for the overlap of two
                    arrays and the containment of one array by another.
                </p>

<pre>postgres@[local]:5432 14:24:57) [test]&gt; select * from array_test where vals &amp;&amp; '{fail}';
 id |           vals
----+--------------------------
  2 | {fail,hrm,"with spaces"}
(1 row)

(postgres@[local]:5432 14:34:00) [test]&gt; select * from array_test where vals @&gt; '{fail,hrm}';
 id |           vals
----+--------------------------
  2 | {fail,hrm,"with spaces"}
(1 row)

(postgres@[local]:5432 14:34:34) [test]&gt; select * from array_test where vals @&gt; '{fail,hrm,nope}';
 id | vals
----+------
(0 rows)

(postgres@[local]:5432 14:34:40) [test]&gt; select * from array_test where vals &lt;@ '{fail,hrm}';
 id | vals
----+------
(0 rows)

(postgres@[local]:5432 14:35:41) [test]&gt; select * from array_test where vals &gt;@ '{fail,hrm,"with spaces","some other value"}';
 id |           vals
----+--------------------------
  2 | {fail,hrm,"with spaces"}
(1 row)</pre>

				<p>
                    The most useful array manipulation operator is
                    <code>||</code>. This is used to join together arrays or to
                    append values to arrays:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 14:40:32) [test]&gt; select vals || 'hi'::text from array_test where id = 1;
        ?column?
------------------------
 {foo,bar,"lol wut",hi}
(1 row)

Time: 1.218 ms
(postgres@[local]:5432 14:40:45) [test]&gt; select vals || '{hi, bye}' from array_test where id = 1;
          ?column?
----------------------------
 {foo,bar,"lol wut",hi,bye}
(1 row)</pre>

                <p>
                    Of course, these operators can be used in
                    <code>update</code> or <code>delete</code> statements as
                    well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For a complete list of functions and operators, see
                    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-array.html">the documentation</a>.
                </p>

                <h3><code>array_agg</code></h3>

                <p>
                    Several functions produce arrays as well. The most
                    important of these is <code>array_agg</code>. This function
                    allow you to aggregate values into an array with a query:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 14:45:23) [test]&gt; select array_agg(id) from array_test;
 array_agg
-----------
 {1,2}</pre>

                <p>
                    Values of any type (as described above) can be aggregated:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 14:45:40) [test]&gt; create table timestamp_test (id serial primary key, val timestamp);
CREATE TABLE
Time: 13.396 ms
(postgres@[local]:5432 14:47:37) [test]&gt; insert into timestamp_test (val) values ('2016-01-01'), ('2015-01-01'), ('1970-01-01');
INSERT 0 3
Time: 2.914 ms
(postgres@[local]:5432 14:48:03) [test]&gt; select array_agg(val) from timestamp_test;
                              array_agg
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"2016-01-01 00:00:00","2015-01-01 00:00:00","1970-01-01 00:00:00"}
(1 row)

Time: 0.385 ms</pre>

                <h3>Applications</h3>

                <p>
                    But what can I actually use arrays for? There are a handful
                    that I have experience with:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Lists</li>
                    <li>Tags</li>
                    <li>Materialized tree children</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <b>Lists</b>. The obvious is lists. Lists of any type can
                    be captured in this way. Say your product needs to save
                    some list of user preferences, and you encode those
                    preferences as strings. User 1 has email preferences of
                    <code>SPAM</code> and <code>HAM</code>. You can just set
                    the user's email preferences like:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 14:48:23) [test]&gt; update users set email_preferences = '{SPAM,HAM}' where id = 1;</pre>

                <p>
                    If you had used a separate table for this, you'd need to
                    check which values exist first (to prevent integrity
                    issues) or delete the old values and recreate everything.
                    For simple lists, using arrays can help simplify your code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Tags</b>. This is how I feel in love with arrays.
                    User-defined tags can be applied, for example, to displayed
                    posts. This isn't that powerful until you want to filter to
                    posts have a certain tag. The old way, with a separate tags
                    table:
                </p>

<pre>select
    *
from
    posts a
where
    exists (
        select
            *
        from
            post_tags x
        where
            a.id = x.post_id
            and x.tag = 'foo'
    )
;</pre>

				<p>
                    Which is quite a bit to type and can be tough to get your
                    ORM to generate. It can also slow down as you get more and
                    more tags, even with proper indexes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inline tags?
                </p>

<pre>select * from posts where tags &amp;&amp; '{foo}'</pre>

                <p>
                    And you can simply add more tags or specify that multiple
                    tags must match. <b>As a fabulous bonus, you can create
                    indexes on arrays in postgres!</b> A query like the above
                    over hundreds of millions of results is still quite performant.
                    To create such an index:
                </p>

<pre>(postgres@[local]:5432 15:07:54) [test]&gt; create index idx_array_test on array_test using gin (vals);
CREATE INDEX</pre>

                <p>
                    <code>using</code> specifies <code>gin</code>, which is a
                    Generalized INverted index. This is a good choice in
                    general. Specialized uses may benefit from using
                    <code>gist</code>. You can learn more about these index
                    types <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/textsearch-indexes.html">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Materialized tree children</b>. SQL is not particularly
                    well-suited for dealing with data in tree form. Querying is
                    not particularly efficient in terms of query writing or
                    performance. Arrays can help you here when you have
                    tree-structured data that is read more often than updated
                    (which is true of most data, in my experience). You can
                    store the direct or total set of children on each node and
                    maintain this using a trigger. You can then quickly find
                    all children from a node by querying for the ids of the
                    children contained in that node's children array.
                </p>

                <h3>But shouldn't you be normalizing?</h3>

                <p>
                    No. Well. Yes. Er. Maybe? Choosing the right abstraction
                    for your needs is important. Using an array can be much
                    simpler. But as soon as you need to encapsulate multiple
                    values you should probably create a second table.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Performance is also a consideration. In the example given
                    above, tags provided an enormous speed improvement when I
                    used them at work. But always measure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, arrays may be easier to use with your programming
                    language or ORM. While many ORMs also allow you to treat
                    related tables as lists natively, this may not always be
                    available.
                </p>

                <h3>Wishlist</h3>

                <p>
                    A major barrier to adopting arrays and using them
                    effectively is foreign keys. In the tree children example
                    above, failure to maintain the list of children correctly
                    may result in incorrect results or other errors. Too, if
                    you want to enforce a specific list of tags (or relate
                    other information to those tags) it's a completely manual
                    process.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>
                    This is the first post in what will be a series about the
                    many awesome features of Postgres. While not comprehensive I
                    hope it gives you some ideas about how to use arrays (or
                    not to use arrays) in your codebase.
