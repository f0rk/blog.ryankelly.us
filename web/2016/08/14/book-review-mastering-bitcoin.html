                    "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos is an
                    in-depth discussion of how bitcoin works at a technical
                    level. It goes to great lengths to describe the theory,
                    algorithms, code, and concerns behind the implementation of
                    Bitcoin. While somewhat dated now, this book is a great
                    resource for anyone wishing to understand this
                    transformative technology better.

                </a>

                <h3>Overview</h3>

                <p>
                    The book begins by envisioning a few characters, each with
                    their own interaction with Bitcoin ecosystem. In the
                    earlier chapters, these characters make a number of
                    appearances. It seems this thematic approach weakens later
                    in the text. While unfortunate, I don't think the quality
                    of the information contained in the book suffers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The book then proceeds to helping you jump right in to the
                    Bitcoin ecosystem with a discussion of how to get your
                    hands on some Bitcoin. The next chapter goes over how to
                    spend your newly obtained Bitcoin and gives an overview of
                    how transactions work, the role of mining, and how
                    transactions are mined into blocks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coverage of the Bitcoin client and its usage follows.
                    Wallet management and chain querying are covered heavily.
                    Creating transactions at the lowest level (including
                    signing and submitting them) is also covered. This chapter
                    is rounded out by a discussion of (then current)
                    alternative Bitcoin clients and client libraries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keys and wallets are then covered in-depth. Understanding
                    how to interact with these two items (and how they interact
                    with the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole) is an important
                    subject. Andreas does a good job explaining the
                    cryptography behind keys as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Transactions are then given consideration. This includes
                    the goriest and nitty grittiest details of how transactions
                    are structured and what each component means. The Bitcoin
                    scripting language is given treatment here as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chapter 6 introduces the Bitcoin network and the types of
                    nodes that operate within it. It also explains how a phone
                    application (or other resource constrained application) can
                    verify payments without necessarily needing the entire
                    blockchain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A detailed discussion of the structure of Bitcoin's
                    blockchain follows. A blockchain, generally speaking, is a
                    series of blocks where the header of each block contains a
                    pointer to the previous block as well as secure
                    representation of each block's data. Bitcoin's blockchain
                    uses Merkle trees (a type of tree where each node contains
                    the combined hash of the children's hashes) and
                    proof-of-work based consensus to ensure security. This
                    chapter is a must read for anyone wishing to better
                    understand what a blockchain is.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most important innovation the Bitcoin brings is covered
                    in chapter 8: consensus. Bitcoin was not the first
                    cryptocurrency. But it was the first successful one. And
                    this chapter helps us understand why: consensus. Prior to
                    Bitcoin, there was no good way to avoid the "double spend"
                    problem. That is, how do you prevent a malicious individual
                    from trying to spend the same amount twice? Consensus, of
                    course, will prevent this. However, getting a network of
                    nodes (including malicious nodes) to agree wasn't solved
                    until Bitcoin introduced mining and proof-of-work. In
                    essence, the Bitcoin network votes on the validity of
                    transactions by voting with processing power. As long as
                    the network is majority "good" nodes, their combined
                    computing power will outvote malicious nodes. On top of
                    that, the amount of computational power that must be
                    expended to undo the entire chain (or even make
                    modifications a few blocks deep) is so enormous that
                    transactions are essentially immutable after a relatively
                    short amount of time. Chapter 8 covers all of this
                    in-depth. To understand this chapter is to understand why
                    Bitcoin was revolutionary. Bitcoin popularized the
                    blockchain but proof-of-work based consensus is really what
                    popularized Bitcoin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alternatives to and descendants of Bitcoin are discussed in
                    chapter 9. A number of technologies and ecoystems that (at
                    the time) we important either in terms of their market
                    value or ideas are covered. This chapter is by no means
                    exhaustive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The book concludes with a discussion on security best
                    practices for Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin exists digitally,
                    theft can occur almost instanteously. And since it is
                    cryptographically secured, loss of private keys result in
                    an irretrievable loss of any associated coins.
                </p>

                <h3>What Worked</h3>

                <p>
                    In my mind there are two really great things about this
                    book: Good coverage of key topics and approachable
                    cryptography.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Good coverage of key topics</b>. All of the important
                    aspects of Bitcoin are covered. Everything you need to know
                    from a technical standpoint about how to interact with the
                    Bitcoin ecosystem is covered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Approachable cryptography</b>. Few times have I read a
                    discussion and felt like I knew what was going on. Kudos to
                    Andreas for making what is usually a very dense subject an
                    enjoyable read.
                </p>

                <h3>What Didn't</h3>

                <p>
                    There are a handful of things I didn't enjoy about this
                    book, though they are fairly minor:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Alice and Bob</b>. Let's just say Alice and Bob retire
                    and there are no more secrets between them. I feel like
                    these characters are overplayed. I also personally don't
                    like the use of characters like this to explain concepts.
                    For whatever reason, I think they make understanding the
                    content <b>more</b> difficult and not less.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Tinfoil hat</b>. Bitcoin has gotten a bad rap and drawn
                    suspicion from business leaders and the government since it
                    helps provide secrecy and can potentially serve to assist
                    in criminal efforts. The author in several cases touts this
                    secrecy as seemingly the one true way. For broader adoption
                    a focus on business cases and how Bitcoin can fit into the
                    existing legal and social frameworks we operate under will
                    be necessary. While privacy is important and reducing the
                    number of trusted entities in a transaction is an important
                    step forward, we can't just throw out our existing systems.
                    So suggesting you buy your first Bitcoin by paying a friend
                    cash is a little... off-putting for readers more focused on
                    business applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Limited discussion of other technologies</b>. Yes, the
                    book is titled "Mastering Bitcoin". I still would've
                    enjoyed more information on the technologies that compete
                    with Bitcoin's choices. Proof-of-work is not the only way.
                    Bitcoin's specific type of proof-of-work isn't the only
                    way. These sorts of things would've added an additional
                    richness.
                </p>

                <h3>Would I recommend this book?</h3>
